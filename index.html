		<h1>What is Code?</h1>
		<p class="author"><strong>Paul Ford, 2015<strong></p>
		<section>
			<h2>The Man in the Taupe Blazer</h2>
			<p>You are an educated, successful person capable of abstract thought. A VP doing an SVP's job. Your office, appointed with decent furniture and a healthy amount of natural light filtered through vertical blinds, is commensurate with nearly two decades of service to the craft of management.</p>
			<p>Copper plaques on the wall attest to your various leadership abilities inside and outside the organization: One, the Partner in Innovation Banquet Award 2011, is from the sales team for your support of its 18-month effort to reduce cycle friction&mdash;net sales increased 6.5 percent; another, the Civic Guidelight 2008, is for overseeing a volunteer team that repainted a troubled public school top to bottom.</p>
			<p>You have a reputation throughout the organization as a careful person, bordering on penny-pinching. The way you'd put it is, you are loath to pay for things that can't be explained. <strong><em>You expect your staff to speak in plain language. This policy has served you well in many facets of operations, but it hasn't worked at all when it comes to overseeing software development.</em></strong></p>
			<p>For your entire working memory, <em>some Internet thing</em> has come along every two years and suddenly hundreds of thousands of dollars (inevitably millions) must be poured into amorphous projects with variable deadlines. Content management projects, customer relationship management integration projects, mobile apps, paperless office things, global enterprise resource planning initiatives&mdash;no matter how tightly you clutch the purse strings, software finds a way to pry open your fingers.</p>
			<!-- emphasized line -->
			<p>Here we go again.</p>
			<p>On the other side of your (well-organized) desk sits <em>this guy</em> in his mid-30s with a computer in his lap. He's wearing a taupe blazer. He's come to discuss spending large sums to create intangible abstractions on a <q>website re-architecture project.</q> He needs money, support for his team, new hires, external resources. It's preordained that you'll give these things to him, because the CEO signed off on the initiative&mdash;>and yet should it all go pear-shaped, you will be responsible. Coders are insanely expensive, and projects that start with uncomfortably large budgets have an ugly tendency to grow from there. You need to understand where the hours will go.</p>
			<p>He says: <q>We're basically at the limits with WordPress.</q></p>
			<p><strong><em>Who wears a taupe blazer?</strong></em></p>
			<p>The CTO was fired six months ago. That CTO has three kids in college and a mustache. It was a bad exit. The man in the taupe blazer (TMitTB) works for the new CTO. <em>She comes from Adobe and has short hair and no mustache.</em></p>
			<p>Here is what you've been told: All of the computer code that keeps the website running must be replaced. At one time, it was very valuable and was keeping the company running, but the new CTO thinks it's garbage. She tells you the old code is spaghetti and your systems are straining as a result. That the third-party services you use, and pay for monthly, are old and busted. Your competitor has an animated shopping cart that drives across the top of the screen at checkout. That cart remembers everything customers have ever purchased and generates invoices on demand. Your cart has no memory at all.</p>
			<p>Salespeople stomp around your office, sighing like theater students, telling you how embarrassed they are by the site.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Nothing works right on mobile.</li>
				<li>Orders are cutting off halfway.</li>
				<li>People are logged out with no warning.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Something must be done.</p>
			<!-- emphasized line -->
			<p>Which is why TMitTB is here.</p>
			<p>Who's he, anyway? Webmaster? IT? No, he's a <q>Scrum Master.</q></p>
			<p><q>My people are split on platform,</q> he continues. <q>Some want to use Drupal 7 and make it work with Magento&mdash;which is still PHP.</q> He frowns. <q>The other option is just doing the back end in Node.js with Backbone in front.</q></p>
			<p>You've furrowed your brow; he eyes you sympathetically and explains: <q>With that option it's all JavaScript, front and back.</q></p>
			<p>Those are all terms you've heard. You've read the first parts of the Wikipedia pages and a book on software project estimation. It made some sense at the time.</p>
			<!-- emphasized line -->
			<p>You ask the universal framing question: <q>Did you cost these options?</q></p>
			<p>He gives you a number and a date. You know in your soul that the number is half of what it should be and that the project will go a year over schedule. He promises long-term efficiencies: The $85,000 in Oracle licenses will no longer be needed; engineering is moving to a free, open-sourced database.</p>
			<!-- emphasized line -->
			<p><q>We probably should have done that back when we did the Magento migration,</q> he says. Meaning, of course, that his predecessor probably should have done that.</p>
			<p>You consult a spreadsheet and remind him that the Oracle contract was renewed a few months ago. So, no, actually, at least for now, you'll keep eating that cost. <strong><em>Sigh.</em></strong></p>
			<p>This man makes a third less than you, and his education ended with a B.S. from a large, perfectly fine state university. But he has 500+ connections on LinkedIn. That plus sign after the <q>500</q> bothers you. How many more than 500 people does he know? Five? Five thousand?</p>
			<p>In some mysterious way, he outranks you. Not within the company, not in restaurant reservations, not around lawyers. Still: He strokes his short beard; his hands are tanned; he hikes; his socks are embroidered with little ninja.</p>
			<p><q>Don't forget,</q> he says, <q>we've got to budget for apps.</q></p>
			<!-- emphasized line -->
			<p>This is real. A Scrum Master in <strong><em>ninja socks</em></strong> has come into your office and said, <q>We've got to budget for apps.</q> Should it all go pear-shaped, his career will be just fine.</p>
			<p>You keep your work in perspective by thinking about barrels of cash. You once heard that a U.S. dry barrel can hold about $100,000 worth of singles. Next year, you'll burn a little under a barrel of cash on Oracle. One barrel isn't that bad. But it's never one barrel. Is this a 5-barrel project or a 10-barreler? More? Too soon to tell. But you can definitely smell money burning.</p>
			<p>At this stage in the meeting, you like to look supplicants in the eye and say, <em>OK, you've given me a date and a budget. But when will it be done?</em> Really, truly, top-line-revenue-reporting finished? Come to confession; unburden your soul.</p>
			<p>This time you stop yourself. You don't want your inquiry to be met by a patronizing sigh of impatience or another explanation about ship dates, Agile cycles, and continuous delivery. Better for now to hide your ignorance. <e>When will it be done?</e> You are learning to accept that the answer for software projects is <strong><em>never.</em></strong></p>

			<h2>Why Are We Here?</h2>
			<p>We are here because the editor of this magazine asked me, <q>Can you tell me what code is?</q></p>
			<p><q>No,</q> I said. <q>First of all, I'm not good at the math. I'm a programmer, yes, but I'm an East Coast programmer, not one of these serious platform people from the Bay Area.</q></p>
			<p>I began to program nearly 20 years ago, learning via oraperl, a special version of the Perl language modified to work with the Oracle database. A month into the work, I damaged the accounts of 30,000 fantasy basketball players. They sent some angry e-mails. After that, I decided to get better.</p>
			<p>Which is to say I'm not a natural. I love computers, but they never made any sense to me. And yet, after two decades of jamming information into my code-resistant brain, I've amassed enough knowledge that the computer has revealed itself.</p>
			<p>Its magic has been stripped away. I can talk to someone who used to work at Amazon.com or Microsoft about his or her work without feeling a burning shame. I'd happily talk to people from Google and Apple, too, <em>but they so rarely reenter the general population.</em></p>
			<p>The World Wide Web is what I know best (I've coded for money in the programming languages Java, JavaScript, Python, Perl, PHP, Clojure, and XSLT), but the Web is only one small part of the larger world of software development. There are 11 million professional software developers on earth, according to the research firm IDC. (An additional 7 million are hobbyists.) That's roughly the population of the greater Los Angeles metro area. Imagine all of L.A. programming. East Hollywood would be for Mac programmers, West L.A. for mobile, Beverly Hills for finance programmers, and all of Orange County for Windows.</p>
			<p>There are lots of other neighborhoods, too: There are people who write code for embedded computers smaller than your thumb. There are people who write the code that runs your TV. There are programmers for everything. They have different cultures, different tribal folklores, that they use to organize their working life. If you told me a systems administrator was taking a juggling class, that would make sense, and I'd expect a product manager to take a trapeze class. I've met information architects who list and rank their friendships in spreadsheets. <strong><em>Security research specialists love to party.</em></strong></p>
			<p>What I'm saying is, I'm one of 18 million. So that's what I'm writing: my view of software development, as an individual among millions.</p>
			<!-- emphasized line -->
			<p>Code has been my life, and it has been your life, too. It is time to understand how it all works.</p>
			<p>Every month it becomes easier to do things that have never been done before, to create new kinds of chaos and find new kinds of order. Even though my math skills will never catch up, I love the work. Every month, code changes the world in some <strong><em>interesting, wonderful, or disturbing way.</em></strong></p>

			<h2>A Note from the Typesetter</h2>
			<p>This piece assumes the skepticism of the non-designer or non-engineer and takes an almost satirical view of the other side of the coin. The visual descriptions of <strong><em>The Man In The Taupe Blazer (TMitTB)</em></strong> are something nearly everyone would be familiar with (if potentially a little self-deprecating) - whether working in the world of technology or not - right down to the <q>fun</q> ninja socks.</p>
			<p>The conclusion of Ford's work is his admission that he himself has spent the better part of 2 decades fighting his <q>code-resistant brain</q> because code has become an integral part of life regardless of whether you work with it. It is no longer sufficient to leave the engineers to it, and like Ford, I believe that we should all have at least a basic understanding of the skeleton that underpins such a large portion of our daily lives.</p>
			<!-- emphasized line -->
			<p>Not everyone needs to be a Y2K web formatting enthusiast, but we should all be, at the least, a little more aware.</p>
			<p>To his point also, understanding the way our digital lives work has allowed him (and I believe the population in general) to have a more flexible framework of how things operate and how we too can change alongside our technology. Adaptation is consistent and constant, and at the root of it all (despite the changes along the way) is a fundamental understanding of basic code.</p>
